    "\n",
    "- Son muy buenos generalizando\n",
    "- Protejen en contra del sobreajuste (overfitting) gracias a la construcción del bootstrapping \n",
    "- También reducen la varianza y por lo tanto mejoran la precisión del modelo\n",
    "- Funcionan muy bien con variables categóricas y variables continuas\n",
    "- No se requiere escalamiento previo de variables \n",
    "- Manejan muy bien el hecho de que haya datos nulos\n",
    "- Son modelos robustos ante valores atípicos (outliers)\n",
    "- Son algoritmos muy estables, cuando hay datos nuevos, el algoritmo no se ve muy afectado. Ya que este nuevo dato puede afectar a un árbol individual, pero es difícil que impacte a todos los árboles. \n",
